                            JavaScript Variables

they are 2 ways we can create Variables in JS var and let
creating Variables have 2 steps 1 declaration and assignment 

this is declaration part 
var a

this is assignment part
a = 'hello'

*you cannot outputting Variables without declaration you will got an error

*we can directly assign value to Variables without declaration and it would be var 

hoisting:
what would happen when we output the variable before declaration and assignment?

console.log(a)
var a = 'before console log'

we didn't got an error but we just got undefined 

why??

reason for this is hoisting 

when the program will be executed all the variables declaration would be hoisted to the top of their scop
which this code become like this 

var a
console.log(a)
a = 'before console log'

*before ES6 all scopes were just 2 types one global scope two function scope

what is scope?
* the current context of execution. but in simple word scope means a limited space that we can put variable, function, objects, constant
are useable.
we have parent scope and child scope and child scope are entry only its means child scope can access to parent scope but not vice versa
